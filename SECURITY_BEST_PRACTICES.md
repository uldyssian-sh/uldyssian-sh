## 🔐 Credential Management

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Use environment variables for sensitive data
export VCENTER_PASSWORD="your_secure_password"
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_key"
```

### Configuration Files
```yaml
# Use placeholders in committed files
vcenter:
  host: vcenter.example.com
  username: administrator@vsphere.local
  password: ${VCENTER_PASSWORD}  # Environment variable
```

### Docker Compose
```yaml
# Use .env files (never commit .env)
environment:
  - VCENTER_PASSWORD=${VCENTER_PASSWORD}
  - GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=${GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD}
```
